# Background

![profile](resize-0251.jpg)

### Data Science Consultant with expertise in time series analysis, statistics, Bayesian modelling, and machine learning with TensorFlow.

I implement data science solutions for organizations across a range of industries through implementation of statistical analysis as well as more advanced machine learning methodologies.

My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland. As such, much of my work has been in the domain of business intelligence; i.e. using machine learning technologies to develop solutions to a wide range of business problems.

## Frequently used techniques and technologies

- ARIMA
- AWS
- InterpretML
- PostgreSQL
- Prophet
- PyMC3
- Python
- R
- Shiny Web Apps
- TensorFlow Probability

## Training Courses
