# Background

![profile](resize-0251.jpg)

I am a data scientist with a passion for statistics and programming.

My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland. As such, much of my work has been in the domain of business intelligence; i.e. using machine learning technologies to develop solutions to a wide range of business problems.

## Examples of past projects

* Delivered extensive seminar titled [TensorFlow 2.0 Essentials: What's New](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/tensorflow-20-essentials-whats-new/0636920307167/) for O'Reilly Media

* Implemented time series forecasting techniques for a local authority which significantly informed future policy considerations for their domain

* Constructed multilevel model which allowed a company to improve prediction accuracy across complex survey data by 15%
