# Background

![profile](resize-0251.jpg)

## Data Science Consultant with expertise in economics and time series analysis

I implement data science solutions for organizations across a range of industries through implementation of statistical analysis as well as more advanced machine learning methodologies.

My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland. As such, much of my work has been in the domain of **business intelligence**; i.e. using machine learning technologies to develop solutions to a wide range of business problems. I most frequently work with Python, R, and SQL.

## Examples of problems that I work on include

- Classification and regression modelling of customer features to identify significant influencing factors on customer interest and sales.
- Interpretable machine learning to identify Diverse Counterfactual Explanations, e.g. what changes in features would turn a non-buyer into a buyer?
- Linear Mixed Effect Modelling with TensorFlow Probability to identify the impact of separate customer segments on overall sales data.
- Time series forecasting of sales data using tools such as ARIMA and Prophet.
- Use of Bayesian analysis to quantify effects of interventions, e.g. how do factors such as economic shifts or marketing campaigns affect customer interest for a product?

Are you working on a similar type of problem that you wish to discuss? If you feel that my expertise can be of help to you, feel free to **[e-mail me](mailto:contact@michael-grogan.com)** to set up an initial discussion.
