# Background

![profile](resize-0251.jpg)

I am a data scientist with expertise in time series analysis, statistics, Bayesian modelling, and machine learning with TensorFlow.

My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland. As such, much of my work has been in the domain of business intelligence; i.e. using machine learning technologies to develop solutions to a wide range of business problems.

I have implemented data science solutions for organizations across a range of industries through implementation of statistical analysis as well as more advanced machine learning methodologies.

In addition, I have delivered numerous seminars and presentations in the areas of data science and machine learning, including the [TensorFlow 2.0 Essentials: What's New](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/tensorflow-20-essentials-whats-new/0636920307167/) training session for O'Reilly Media.
