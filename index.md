# Testimonials

_Michael Grogan is the best data scientist I have ever worked with. I found him through his web site. From his first email, it was clear Michael is a professional and capable individual who truly cares about his clients and ensuring their success. I had a significant project to complete on a tight timeline._

_Despite changing expectations and scope, Michael was able to deliver timely, comprehensive, and, most importantly, easy-to-understand analysis of my data. Michael and I live in different continents and are separated by several time zones. This was never an issue and it was easy to communicate with him via Skype and email._

_Normally, I don’t write these types of testimonials, but I feel compelled to write one for him, because without his knowledge and willingness to dive deep into my data and utilize different statistical methods, my project would have not been successful. Thanks, Michael._

**J. Gariepy, Communications Manager**


_Michael’s website is a fantastic reference point for anyone interested in Data Science. He provides real world problems and solutions, showing practical applications often lacking in online resources. He approaches Data Science from a strong mathematics background, providing a fresh perspective not found in the mostly computer science based tutorials._

**B. Larson, Analytics4all**


_“We certainly want to publish your R-Shiny article. This is a superb effort. To be honest, I don’t get many article drafts as well written, structured and crafted as this, so special kudos for that.”_

**Editor, Sitepoint**
