# Background

![profile](resize-0251.jpg)

I am a machine learning consultant and educator with a passion for statistics, programming, and data science. I have a particular interest in the use of time series analysis to generate business intelligence solutions. Some favoured techniques in this regard include ARIMA, LSTM, and the open-source Prophet library by Facebook.

My "go-to" machine learning platform is **TensorFlow**, having previously delivered the [TensorFlow 2.0 Essentials: What's New](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/tensorflow-20-essentials-whats-new/0636920307167/) seminar for O'Reilly Media.

My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland.
