# Background

![profile](resize-0251.jpg)

I am a data scientist with expertise in TensorFlow and time series analysis.

My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland. As such, much of my work has been in the domain of business intelligence; i.e. using machine learning technologies to develop solutions to a wide range of business problems.
